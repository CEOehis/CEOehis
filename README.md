I am a full stack JavaScript developer based in Lagos nigeria. I love solving problems with code. I mainly program in JavaScript but I've written some Python, Ruby and Go and I am always learning. I love clean code and well written code and team best practices like CI/CD integrations and testing. At my spare time, I like thinking about what the universe is like and pondering the possibilities of parallel universes.
